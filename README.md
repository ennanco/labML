#Laboratory for Machine Learning for regression
This module contains no more than a simple set of scripts. Their objetive is to perform a set of different experiments with several regression appporaches in machine learning. The results is a general idea of how well this techniques work with different standarized techniques and some dimension reduction.

After that, the researcher is encourage to explore a fine-tuning of the more prominent techniques to obtain the best model.

## TODO list:
* [] Include a RandomSearch in the process to select also the more prominent approaches
* [] Add classition techniques
* [] Allow the inclussion of other aproaches in a more organical way (for example, config file)

## Dependencies (python)
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* pathlib
* rich
